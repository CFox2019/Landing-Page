# Project Description

This is my Udacity Landing Page project. My landing page contains multiple sections and a navigational menu that hightlights the active element as the page is scrolled or navigation item is clicked. This behavior is implemented in and controlled by javascript; specifically, the app.js file. Additionally, the page is responsive and optimized to support mobile, tablet and desktop browsers.
